                <p id='production-facts'>The James Cameron romance-disaster film <span class="italic">Titanic</span> is a fictionalized historical drama about the sinking of the RMS Titanic.
                It follows two star-crossed lovers as they unwittingly set sail straight into an iceberg.
                *Spoiler Alert* The boat sinks and one of them dies.
                It would remain the most expensive film ever made until the overblown Peter Jackson remake of King Kong was released in 2005.
                It was also the highest-grossing film of all time until James Cameron decided to make a futuristic version with Avatar (2010) in which the ship is a environmentally-sensitive planet and the lovers are tall, blue cat-aliens.

                <p id='oscars-facts'>Titanic was nominated for 14 Academy Awards, a feat that had not been achieved since All About Eve (1950).
                It went on to win 11 of those categories.
                Fans of the film's lead actor, Leonardo diCaprio, will note that this was one of many snubs on his road to finally winning an Oscar; not only did he fail to receive a nomination, but Best Actor that year was a so-so Jack Nicholson performance in the mildly entertaining rom-com As Good As It Gets (1997).
                The lead actress, Kate Winslet, did earn herself a nomination from the Academy for her portrayal of naive, privledged white-girl Rose Dawson but failed to win her category.
                The biggest insult was that the actress who took the role of Kate Winslet's mother in the film was nominated for an Oscar for barely a few lines of a monologue that really doesn't stand the test of time and took about as much to 'act' as a background character in an episode of The O.C.

                It is important to note that everyone has a favorite scene or character in this lush portrayal of early 19th century cruise ship travel.
                Mine is the classic scene where the couple decides to climb a few stories down a slippery below-deck boat ladder and run amok through the boiler room while the working poor shovel coal into the enormous boilers.
                The head stoker yells at them gruffly, "What are you two doing in the boiler room?!".
                I'd like to ask James Cameron that myself someday.
