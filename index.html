                    <p>The James Cameron romance-disaster film <a class="movie-title" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/">Titanic</a> is a fictionalized historical drama about the sinking of the RMS Titanic.
                    It follows two star-crossed lovers as they unwittingly set sail straight into an iceberg.
                    **Spoiler Alert** The boat sinks and one of them dies.
                    It would remain the most expensive film ever made until the overblown Peter Jackson remake of <a class="movie-title" href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/5-reasons-why-peter-jacksons-king-kong-is-a-brilliant-example-of-a-remake-done-right/">King Kong</a> was released in 2005.
                    It was also the highest-grossing film of all time until James Cameron decided to make a futuristic version with <a class="movie-title" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)">Avatar</a> in which the ship is a environmentally-sensitive planet and the lovers are tall, blue cat-aliens.

                    <p>Titanic was nominated for 14 Oscars, a feat that had not been achieved since <a class="movie-title" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000626-all_about_eve">All About Eve</a> swept the awards in 1950.
                    It went on to win 11 of those categories.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Fans of the film's lead actor, Leonardo diCaprio, will note that this was one of many snubs on his road to finally winning an Oscar; not only did he fail to receive a nomination, but Best Actor that year was a so-so Jack Nicholson performance in the only mildly-entertaining rom-com <a class="movie-title" href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/as-good-as-it-gets-1997">As Good As It Gets</a>.
                    Titanic's lead actress, Kate Winslet, did earn herself a nomination from the Academy for her portrayal of Rose "Doesn't Know How To Share a Door" Dawson, but failed to win her category.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The biggest insult of the evening was that Kate Winslet's mother in the film was nominated for an Oscar for barely a few lines of a monologue that neither stood the test of time nor took more acting chops than a background character in an episode of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-O-C-Season-1/dp/B001AVW600">The O.C.</a>

                    <p>It is important to note that everyone has a favorite scene in this lush portrayal of early 19th century cruise ship travel.
                    Mine is the absolutely classic scene where the couple decides to climb a few stories down a slippery below-deck boat ladder and run amok through the boiler room while the working poor shovel coal into enormous furnaces.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The head stoker yells at them gruffly, "What are you two doing in the boiler room?!".
                    Yeah James Cameron, what <span class="italic">were</span> they doing in the boiler room?
